## What it does

BotBuddy finds people who maybe want to do a music jam, attend a hackathon, play games(CS: GO, Valorant, etc) or spend time having long conversations about quantum mechanics or Shakespeare. It can be added to any large discord community and be used by anyone to find your next partner in crime!

## Inspiration

The current pandemic has affected millions physically and more than that, mentally. We have seen many people feeling lost and lonely, and felt the need to create a centralized system which caters to find people with similar interests so that they can find friends and spend time more productively and have fun at the same time. The accessibility of discord bots was another leading factor in inspiring us.

## Tools

The bot was built using python with the discord.py API wrapper. We used the Pandas library to manage the data on the server. We took some user interviews to make it as easy to use as possible. Graphic assets are created on Adobe Photoshop and Figma.

## What's next for BotBuddy

First of all we plan to deploy the bot so that it becomes accessible to all instantly. We also plan on expanding it to custom activities, have a better verification process integrated, and give a more personal touch to the bot so that it can frequently post multiple requests in a general tab.

We can also provide special rewards or coupon codes for high-rated people, and thus, introduce a level system to ensure that no one is mistreated and people can easily get together in these times of turmoil.
